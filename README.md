# Apex-Legends-Esp

This is a source built with in an hour so it has many sharp edges, but it works fine tho, i actually removed the aimbot from this source cz its kinda private but it isnt hard to do.

This project uses the functionality of Windows GDI function exposed to C++ with ease, it uses the source of NULL for Driver (connection from kernal to user mode, for more info read about ring 0)

I also have added comments on Main.cpp file for newbies and the rest is self-explanatory, so i hope you guys get an idea about how this works.

Now for those who doesnt play Apex-Legends and want to make esp for their own game, its a great news that this source can work on ANY GAME, because it uses windows gdi its easy to build just read correct offsets and add stuffs you need,

Remember you CANNOT play your game on full screen as this is an external cheat.

ENJOY GUYS!!
